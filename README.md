üìù I write smart contracts for myself and other people in Solidity and associated frontend GUIs in React

üîé I scan blockchains for other people's smart contracts to find Maximum Extractable Value (MEV)

ü§ì I audit other people's smart contracts


![Tracing what a smart contract is doing in the EVM](https://github.com/0xevm1/0xEVM1/blob/main/evm-efficiency-tracer.gif)


I can do some of those things for you too! I'm passionate about knowing the latest in smart contract development trends, and what projects are coming to the market. 

### Open Source Projects

I typically do not contribute to open source DeFi protocols, although since thats what _**you**_ want to see, periodically I upload or can make public some examples of my work and competence.

- ‚õΩÔ∏è [SAVE GAS! Solidity and Typescript "Data packing" and "bitpacking" example](https://github.com/0xevm1/chad-dao-solidity-bit-packing) to save everyone gas.

To that end, I'm also working in Rust, and have picked up many programming languages and frameworks over years, helped by my Computer Science degree.



### My favorite frameworks, libraries and tools
