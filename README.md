### 0xEVM1 ⚙️🔨

📝 I write smart contracts for myself and other people in Solidity and associated frontend GUIs in React

🔎 I scan blockchains for other people's smart contracts to find Maximum Extractable Value (MEV)

🤓 I audit other people's smart contracts

I can do some of those things for you too!

I'm passionate about knowing the latest in smart contract development trends, and what projects are coming to the market. I typically do not contribute to open source DeFi protocols, periodically I upload or make public some examples of my work and competence.

- [Solidity and Typescript "Data packing" and "bitpacking" example](https://github.com/0xevm1/chad-dao-solidity-bit-packing) to save everyone gas.

To that end, I'm also working in Rust, and have picked up many programming languages and frameworks over years, helped by my Computer Science degree.
